A cute happy sloth, wishing you a happy day :)
## About me
I'm **Timon Ensel**, a computer science student at the **T**echnical **U**niversity of **M**unich.

Mid 2022 I finally found my way into open source projects and love contributing to them ever since. My current main focus is [Xournal++](https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp), the greatest annotator in C++ out there :)

  
My prgramming language repertoire includes, but is not limited to:
- **Java**, my first ever language
- **Bash**, because I love Linux and love pain 
- **C**, because you just need it
- **C++**, my *favorite* of them all
