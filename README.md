# Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

## About me
I'm **Timon Ensel**, a computer science student at the **T**echnical **U**niversity of **M**unich.

Mid 2022 I finally found my way into open source projects and love contributing to them ever since. My current main focus is [Xournal++](https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp), the greatest annotator in C++ out there :)

  
My prgramming language repertoire includes, but is not limited to:
- **Java**, my first ever language
- **Bash**, because I love Linux and love pain 
- **C**, because you just need it
- **C++**, my *favorite* of them all

## My repository guide
You can find a repo guide for all my repos (with short description) in the [repo-guide](https://github.com/forgottosave/forgottosave/blob/main/repo-guide.md)

<!---
forgottosave/forgottosave is a special repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
