# Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

## About me
I'm **Timon Ensel**, a computer science student at the **T**echnical **U**niversity of **M**unich.

Mid 2022 I finally found my way into open source projects and love contributing to them ever since :)

  
My prgramming language repertoire includes, but is not limited to:
- **Java**, the first language I learned
- **Bash**, because I love Linux 
- **C**, because you just need it
- **C++**, my *favorite* of them all

Furthermore I have experience in Assembler, SQL, OCaml, Python, Javascript, HTML & CSS (in descending order of my knowledge about them)
