## About me
I'm [**Timon Ensel**](https://timon-ensel.de), a computer science student at the [**T**echnical **U**niversity of **M**unich](https://www.tum.de/).
Mid 2022 I finally found my way into open source projects and love contributing to them ever since :)

#### Interests & Skills

[![Git](https://img.shields.io/badge/Git-F05032?logo=git&logoColor=fff)](#)
[![C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/C++-%2300599C.svg?logo=c%2B%2B&logoColor=white)](#)
[![Bash](https://img.shields.io/badge/Bash-4EAA25?logo=gnubash&logoColor=fff)](#)
[![Fedora](https://img.shields.io/badge/Fedora-51A2DA?logo=fedora&logoColor=fff)](#)

I love software development & engineering, with my focus and expertise concerning programming languages being mainly **C++**, but also including C, bash, python, Java, and many more.

In 2024 I finished my Bachelor's Thesis at the TUM Chair of Connected Mobility, together with APSensing. I developed a **T**erminal **U**ser **I**nterface (TUI) for OSTree, which, of course, is open source and can be found in the repo [APSensing/ostree-tui](https://github.com/AP-Sensing/ostree-tui).

I am currently continuing my studies at TUM, aiming for a Master degree in Informatics.

#### My Repos
My public repositories mostly contain some [scripts](https://github.com/forgottosave/obsidian-link-converter) or [games](https://github.com/forgottosave/snash) programmed in bash. Appart from that I currently maintain a small [app](https://github.com/forgottosave/LichessWebApp) focussed on accessing [lichess](https://github.com/lichess-org) via the android browser.
