# Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

## About me
I'm **Timon Ensel**, a computer science student at the [**T**echnical **U**niversity of **M**unich](https://www.tum.de/).
Mid 2022 I finally found my way into open source projects and love contributing to them ever since :)

#### Interests & Skills
My focus and expertise concerning programming languages lies on **C** and **C++**, but also includes bash, python, Java, Assembly, SQL, OCaml, HTML & CSS (in descending order of my knowledge about them).

In my free time I'm currently buzy learning about Cloud Computing, mainly using AWS and AWS-educate for some example/test projects. Maybe later I will publish my repository containing that knowledge and projects.

#### My Repos
My public repositories mostly contain simple [scripts](https://github.com/forgottosave/svg_to_m3u) or [games](https://github.com/forgottosave/snash) programmed in bash. Appart from that I currently have a small [app](https://github.com/forgottosave/LichessWebApp) focussed on accessing [lichess](https://github.com/lichess-org) via the android browser.

## Contact me
Please contact me via e-mail: timon.ensel@tum.de
