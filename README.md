# Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

## About me
I'm [**Timon Ensel**](https://timon-ensel.de), a computer science student at the [**T**echnical **U**niversity of **M**unich](https://www.tum.de/).
Mid 2022 I finally found my way into open source projects and love contributing to them ever since :)

#### Interests & Skills
My focus and expertise concerning programming languages lies on **C** and **C++**, but also includes bash, python, Java and Assembly.

I am currently right in the middle of writing my Bachelor's Thesis at the TUM Chair of Connected Mobility, together with APSensing. I am working on a **T**erminal **U**ser **I**nterface (TUI) for OSTree, next to some general TUI evaluation. The code is, of course, open source and can be found in the repo [APSensing/ostree-tui](https://github.com/AP-Sensing/ostree-tui).

#### My Repos
My public repositories mostly contain some [scripts](https://github.com/forgottosave/obsidian-link-converter) or [games](https://github.com/forgottosave/snash) programmed in bash. Appart from that I currently maintain a small [app](https://github.com/forgottosave/LichessWebApp) focussed on accessing [lichess](https://github.com/lichess-org) via the android browser.
